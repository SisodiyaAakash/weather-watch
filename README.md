## Getting Started

To run the app, you'll need to add your API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to the environment variable.

### Adding the API Key

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

2. Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `"Your Key"` with your actual API key:
   REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY="Your Key"
